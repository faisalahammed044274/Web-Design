                <h1 align="center">6 STEPS TO BECOMING A FULL STACK DEVELOPER</h1>
                <p>Full stack developer has become one of the most sought-after positions in the technology domain.
                    The boom in this area has led to the mushrooming of both web-based and in-class training centers,
                    which help individuals become full stack developers (and this has nothing to do with piling up a
                    stack of pancakes at IHOP!).
                    Some of these centers also support trainees to get plum coding jobs at the end of the course.</p>
                <h2>Who is a full stack developer?</h2>
                <p>A programmer skilled in coding both the frontend and the backend parts of a web application is called
                    a full stack web developer.</p>
                <p><strong>The frontend:</strong> This is the part of the web application that the user sees and uses.
                </p>
                <p><strong>The backend:</strong> These are parts of the application that function behind the scenes and
                    execute the commands issued by the user. This usually includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logical processes</li>
                    <li>Database-related processes</li>
                    <li>Validation of users</li>
                    <li>Server configuration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A full stack developer is not expected to be an expert in all areas pertaining to the frontends and
                    backends.
                    The individual needs to be knowledgeable in all the technologies involved and should be able to
                    understand the processes happening within the entire application.</p>
                <p>You can become a full stack developer by following a few simple steps, such as:</p>
                <h3>Step 1: Learn the necessary programming languages</h3>
                <p>A full stack developer needs to know the following technologies:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Backend technologies
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>PHP</li>
                            <li>Java</li>
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>SQL</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Step 2: Refine the knowledge</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Servers and their functioning</li>
                    <li>Networks and their nuances</li>
                    <li>Web-hosting environments</li>
                    <li>Algorithms and their formulation</li>
                    <li>Data structures (types, properties, and use)</li>
                    <li>Programming technologies</li>
                    <li>Databases and their management</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Step 3: Become familiar with all technologies but a master of one</h3>
                <p>As the scope of your leaning expands, you will realize that there is much more to learn than you
                    possibly can master. Most programmers fail because they try to learn too much of too many things.
                    There is no need for such efforts. Master one and understand the rest.
                    Learn how to work in them and that should be good enough.</p>
                <p>As your experience grows, your ease with the technologies will also improve. Take pains to specialize
                    in one technology. Choose a technology popular among clients.
                    This should help you compete effectively with others in the field and produce outstanding work. And
                    with the way this economy is growing with lower taxes, you should have a bright career ahead and be
                    able to relocate other states if you wish to</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Take a course</h3>
                <p>Even the best prepared should be willing to keep learning new things to remain relevant.
                    New technologies join the foray frequently — no one knows everything. A full stack developer needs
                    to stay abreast of these changes. Taking online or virtual courses is an easy way to keep
                    upskilling.
                    Among the many organizations offering technology courses online are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></li>
                    <p>A word of caution: Avoid costly courses that promise to teach everything in a matter of hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since the objective is to learn theory and get practical exposure within the shortest time
                        possible, choose courses that offer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mentoring by knowledgeable coders.</li>
                        <li>Flexible schedule that matches yours.</li>
                        <li>Projects as part of the curriculum (see the University of Phoenix, which incorporates
                            teamwork into the curriculum with acumen).</li>
                        <li>Tutoring to clarify doubts (either individually or in groups).</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 5: Get practical exposure</h3>
                <p>The most challenging part of the process is when you have a thorough understanding of all the
                    necessary technologies—HTML/CSS, JavaScript, back-end programming, databases, and HTTP/REST.
                    Time has come to use all this knowledge in an application. For this, you need to know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The right way to structure code.</li>
                    <li>Means to separate files.</li>
                    <li>Environment to host large media files.</li>
                    <li>The right data structures to use.</li>
                    <li>Location of each computational task (client-side or server-side).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Theoretical knowledge can be obtained by reading online materials, but to understand application
                    architecture properly, you must implement an actual web application.</p>
                <p>Working with a team is the ideal way to accomplish this through an individual can also develop an
                    application alone. This exercise adds the all-essential practical exposure to the technology toolkit
                    of a full-stack developer.</p>
                <p>A few companies may insist on an applicant having a degree in computer science to apply for the
                    position, but most will overlook education if a candidate can exhibit the necessary coding
                    abilities.</p>
                <h3>Step 6: Take up additional assignments</h3>
                <p>Join additional projects in your company that work on technologies outside your expertise. This way
                    you will upskill and add extra value to your organization as well. Most companies will appreciate
                    these types of initiatives — just don’t try to show anyone up and courteous in your pursuit of
                    learning.</p>

                <h2>Not as hard as it may look</h2>
                <p>In the beginning, the journey to becoming a full stack developer might appear herculean. But
                    experience makes the process easier. Continuously upgrading your skill-set is not as daunting as it
                    may appear at first. Moreover, being able to understand all aspects of a project will make you an
                    indispensable part of your company or department.</p>

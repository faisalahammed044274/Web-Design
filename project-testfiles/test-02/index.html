          <h2>Is your house cat spreading the coronavirus?</h2>
          <p>
            A recent <i>study has found</i> that ferrets and cats can be
            infected with <b>COVID-19</b>, and can also pass the virus on to
            members of their species â€” under laboratory conditions. There is
            less risk with other domesticated animals.
